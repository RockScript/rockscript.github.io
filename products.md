<h2>RockScript Server</h2>
<p>The full functionality of the RockScript server is available under 
The Apache License v2.  This includes a HTTP web API and a command
line interface  (CLI).
Check out <a href="https://github.com/rockscript/rockscript/wiki">the RockScript 
open source project on GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="webui">RockScript Web UI</h2>
<p>Below, you can see a preview of the commercial web UI tool we're building on top of the 
RockScript server. The script execution viewer gives a debugger experience for ongoing 
or past script executions.  That's possible because script executions are stored with 
event sourcing.
</p>
<p>In the middle, you see the events which can be navigated up and down.  On the left, the 
line corresponding to the selected event is highlighted. And on the right the variable values 
are shown at the time of the selected event.
