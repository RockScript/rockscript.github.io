RockScript is the company behind the RockScript open source project.  
We offer <a href="../products/">products</a> and professional services for RockScript.

RockScript was founded by Tom Baeyens, who builds on the experience after having 
creating [jBPM](https://www.jbpm.org), (JBoss / Red Hat), [Activiti](https://www.activiti.org) 
(Alfresco) and SaaS BPM product [Workflow Accellerator](https://www.signavio.com/products/workflow-accelerator/)

With RockScript our goal is to make microservice integration orders of magnitude simpler 
to build, maintain and operate.
