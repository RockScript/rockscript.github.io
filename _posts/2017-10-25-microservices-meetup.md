I'll introduce RockScript at the 
[Microservices meetup in London November 1st](https://www.meetup.com/London-Microservices-User-Group/events/236872165/), 
6:30 pm - 8pm  at SkillsMatter ([map](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=10+South+Place%2C+London%2C+EC2M+2RB%2C+gb))

Learn how easy it is to build resilient integrations between microservices, SaaS web  
API’s and cloud service API’s.  RockScript is easy because it leverages JavaScript syntax. 
The engine persists the execution state with event sourcing.  This enables long running 
activities, crash recovery and extreme visibility.  We’ll explain the the core concept 
of an activity and how it enables more readable business logic in the scriptVersions and prevents 
that error handling and operational aspects creep in the code.  We’ll also compare 
RockScript to alternatives like AWS Step Functions, Netflix Conductor and Microsoft 
Logic Apps.
